== The thought process of approaching this
In order to succeed and not be a "paster", a thorough familiarization of the C++ programming language and various programming concepts are necessary. It is expected to take many months and lots of practice, as if learning a new spoken language such as Italian. If you were looking to make a game hack quickly, that's not possible, go ahead and use a pre-existing game hack to calm your itch.

You cannot under any circumstances use AI for assistance, it has too many inaccuracies, and no shortcuts are to be taken. A much later example of a shortcut would be using ImGui instead of creating your own cheat menu.

== What if I struggle with focus/reading?
Use a Pomodoro timer to accomodate. My recommendation is using https://github.com/Splode/pomotroid[Pomotroid]. For stress management, a Pomodoro timer will also be helpful if you extend the long breaks for yourself.
Don't be afraid to increase the focus time if it's too short, but do it sparingly. For ADHD, shorter focus times such as 20 minutes with 1 to 2 minute short breaks might work better.

== Learning vital concepts

If you are unaware of what to use to program in C with, the recommended choice is https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/[Visual Studio] if you're on Windows. For Linux it'd be https://repology.org/project/vscode/versions[Visual Studio Code]. You can go with options like Neovim, but the point is to get started in learning C with the least amount of friction.

.For Visual Studio, install the following extensions for it:
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=caphyon.ClangPowerTools
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MikeWard-AnnArbor.VSColorOutput

.For Visual Studio code, install the following extensions for it:
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jeff-hykin.better-cpp-syntax

Start off with https://openstax.org/books/introduction-computer-science/pages/2-introduction[this book], which teaches both computer science concepts and some of the C programming language. We'll learn C++ later on as it is necessary for hacking video games effectively.

After you are finished with that book, it is required to install a program to view .epub or .pdf files is necessary for the next book. On Windows this would be https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org[Sumatra PDF], while for Linux this would be https://johnfactotum.github.io/foliate/[Foliate].

Now is the time to learn C++ from a book called Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ (C++ In-depth) 3rd Edition, you can find it from Amazon, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Library[Z-Library], or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna%27s_Archive[Anna's Archive].

== x64 Intel assembly
It is necessary to know this in order to debug problems you run across, and to reverse engineer video games.

.Start by learning from the following resources:
- https://pwn.college/welcome/welcome/
- https://pwn.college/computing-101/assembly-crash-course/
- https://pwn.college/computing-101/memory/

Command to compile assembly code for pwn.college: `nasm -f elf64 asm.S -o asm.o && ld asm.o -o asm_executable`

Explanations for the most used registers; start with https://treeniks.github.io/x86-64-simplified/system-v-abi.html first then proceed to read the other pages.

Reference names and descriptions for a lot of registers: http://ref.x86asm.net/geek64.html

== Learning game hacking

. Tools to install for game hacking:
- https://github.com/ReClassNET/ReClass.NET; be sure to compile this yourself, otherwise you'll miss out on 4 years of improvements.
- https://www.cheatengine.org/; press "Skip All" in its installer to avoid installing any of the advertisements.
- https://x64dbg.com/
- https://www.systeminformer.com/; for its injector. To use it, right-click on the desired executable, click on `Properties`, `Modules`, then `Options` -> `Load module` to inject a DLL into that process.
- Purchase Binary Ninja Personal edition, or find "IDA Pro 9.0.240925 RC1" from the official source, don't settle for less.

. Now for the fundamentals of game hacking:
- https://gamehacking.academy/
- Use their Discord if you need help, but search for what you're stuck on first before asking.

. After you've made bunnyhop and other forms of simple hacks. Learn to do an aimbot or ESP by reading this book to fully understand the math behind them:
- https://www.gamemath.com/book/
